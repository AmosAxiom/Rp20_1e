\chapter{Leveling Up}
This is where the extensibility of Rp20 comes into play. Whenever you level up your character, you are either investing in a character level, or one of the special classes that your GM is using for the campaign. Typically, only a character level gives you an additional point with which to improve your core attributes, improve the number of uses your style has, and learn skills.

The tradeoff to losing a character level is that spending a level on a special class gives you access to abilities that you wouldn’t have otherwise.

GM’s may come up with skill trees and abilities that you may gain by investing a level in a special class, or use one of the example classes provided.

Balance can be tricky, which is why Rp20 tries to use levels as a sort of currency which helps to standardize what a character can gain by investing in a class level. This also makes it possible to mix and match classes from different settings without too much need to adjust for balance.

This is described further in the “Guidelines for GMs” chapter.
